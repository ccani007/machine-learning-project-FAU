Through this course, we'll learn to implement and understand different modeling techniques using the `tidymodels` framework in R.\n\n### What You'll Find Here\n\n-   **Course Notes**: Detailed explanations of concepts and methodologies\n-   **Model Implementations**: Hands-on examples of different models:\n    -   Logistic Regression\n    -   Lasso Regression\n    -   Decision Trees\n    -   Random Forest\n    -   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n-   **YRBS 2023 Dataset**: Information about our primary dataset\n-   **Interactive Visualizations**: Results and insights from our models\n\n### Getting Started\n\nNavigate through the different sections using the menu above. Each model section contains: - Model explanation - Implementation code - Results and interpretations - Visualizations - Key takeaways\n\nFeel free to explore and learn!\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::",
